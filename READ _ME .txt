Please open the "PDFIMG" folder, and run the Start.py script 


It works on UTF8 encoded pdfs, which I have previously converted using pyocr and n++.
It generates a sample .txt output file, in this case:

	Prinicpal_Output.txt
	delhi.txt
	Kolkata.txt
	
These PDF's have been noise-rectified by converting them to black and white 
using cv2

	Chennai_Output.txt
	Allahbad.txt
	1.txt
		to be converted into a csv

After running the convert_csv.py script, a csv file is generated using tab and /n as delimitters.
this CSV is noted:

	Perfect successes:
	Principal_Output.csv
	delhi.csv
	Kolkata.csv



please open this in a tabbed sheet!
Chennai.csv was an issue due to columns within undetectable rows-within rows.
An approach to that using pyocr was tested by me.

Tech/libraries used: python, java, pdfminer, pyocr, opencv, fontbox.jar, n++

I also have a lot of other raw sample data, and other test cases in this folder I approached before formulating my final method.

The FINAL folder contains output data.
